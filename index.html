		<h1>Emily Schroeder</h1>
		<h3>Visual Communication Design Major</h3>
		<h4>Background Information</h4>
		<p>I was born in Los Angeles, CA but have lived most of my life in Kennewick, WA. Some of my family still lives in Southern California so I was able to visit there often while growing up. Being able to travel frequently to a large city outside of my home state has opened my eyes to many new ideas. It has helped me in expanding my knowledge of other cultures and has made me want to experience different areas of my own state of Washington as well. I am currently at Eastern Washington University and look forward to where the next chapter of my life takes me.</p>

<h4>Professional Objectives</h4>
<p>My goal for a career in Visual Communication Design is to work at a graphic design firm and create graphics for a living. I have always been interested in graphic design and look forward to designing for a living. From my background and being able to explore the large city of Los Angeles, I have been able to experience firsthand the fast paced life of a great city full of arts and culture. I would like to use this knowledge and experience to create designs that are relevant to our society and that can compete with other great areas of our country. </p>
